<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Built With
Tell us wich technologies you used to build your project
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/)

## Getting Started

I used a Docker environnement to run this project, but this is such an overkill for this project requirements, I'll let you explain how you managed to run it on your own computer

### Prerequisites

Here you should probaly explain that you need to use blog_projet.sql in order to populate your mysql database.
```sh
// The command to import an sql file to mysql... Or an exmplanation on how to import it with another tool
```

## Usage

How is the project used, what can a regular user do ? You could add some screenshots to demonstrate
